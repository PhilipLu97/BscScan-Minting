# BscScan-Minting
I used this script to verify how much [CAKE](https://pancakeswap.finance) gets emitted net of burns from Pancakeswap's [MasterchefV2 contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0xa5f8c5dbd5f286960b9d90548680ae5ebff07652#code). As far as I can tell, Pancakeswap's team's claims about [~321,200 CAKE being emitted daily](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics) (~2,248,400 weekly) are fairly accurate. 

You'll need to install [bscscan-python](https://github.com/pcko1/bscscan-python) and sign up for an account on [BscScan](https://bscscan.com/) to generate an API key. BscScan's [events (logs) endpoint](https://docs.bscscan.com/api-endpoints/logs) returns up to 1,000 objects per query. I queried in periods of 40,320 BSC blocks because I found out through manual testing that the API would return nearly 1,000 minting objects for periods of around 56,000-69,000 blocks (*only for CAKE specifically*). Making 5 queries total was enough for my purposes, as the API rate limits to 5 queries/s, but if you need more, you'll need to update the algorithm to loop between querying the API up to 5 times at once and sleeping for around 1 s.
